		"The 8th Algerian-French Political Consultations at the level of the secretaries general of Foreign Affairs Ministries was held Friday, in Paris, under the co-presidency of Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and National Community Abroad, Amar Belani and Secretary General of the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Anne Marie Descôtes.",
		"This meeting, held after the State and friendship visit paid by the French President to Algeria at the invitation of President of the Republic Abdelmadjid Tebboune from 25 to 27 August, enabled the two sides to examine relations and cooperation between the two countries, with a view to implementing the Declaration of Algiers under the renewed partnership between Algeria and France, signed on 27 August 2022 in Algiers. The discussions enabled the two countries to identify concrete ways to strengthen cooperation, in anticipation of its validation on the occasion of the 5th Algerian-French High-Level Intergovernmental Committee, scheduled for 9-10 October 2022.",
		"These discussions were also an opportunity to exchange views on regional and international issues of common interest, notably the Libyan issue, the Western Sahara issue, the situation in the Sahel and Mali as well as other global issues."
