		"Algeria said on Sunday that peace cannot be achieved in Palestine without a \"firm and courageous\" position of the international community, in particular of the UN Security Council, which makes it possible to re-launch the process of political settlement to end the occupation of the Palestinian territories and allow the Palestinian people to establish their independent state with El-Quds as capital.",
		"In an address to the extraordinary meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) foreign ministers, held by videoconference, Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr Sabri Boukadoum, renewed the \"strong condemnation by Algeria of the barbaric acts committed by the occupying forces against the Palestinian people,\" reaffirming its \"steadfast position of principle in favor of the just Palestinian cause and the Palestinian brothers in this difficult situation.\"",
		"Mr Boukadoum called on the international community, in particular the Security Council, to \"assume its historical, legal and moral responsibilities in the protection of the Palestinian people,\" urging \"work without delay to stop the machine of death and destruction, halt the barbaric attacks on the life and property of this brotherly people and guarantee respect for the rules of international law\".",
		"Mr Boukadouam said that the OIC extraordinary meeting \"follows the anniversary of the Nakba and as systematic criminal attacks against our Palestinian brothers continue in the occupied city of El-Quds, in the West Bank and in all the occupied territories, through the intensification of barbaric strikes on the Ghaza strip, leaving a significant number of martyrs and wounded, including children and women, and the massive destruction of infrastructure.\"",
		"The foreign minister hoped that this meeting \"makes it possible to mobilize the Organization's resources and capacities in the service of the Palestinian cause.‚Äù",
		"\"These vile attacks in flagrant violation of all international human rights charters and humanitarian laws are once again challenging the credibility of the multipolar world order,\" Mr Boukadoum said, adding that \"because of the immunity it enjoys, the occupation persists in its heinous crimes and racist policies, which negates the prospects for a just and comprehensive solution and complicates the situation in the entire region as shown current events \"."
