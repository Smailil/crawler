		"Algeria is following with great concern the latest developments in the Republic of Mali and stresses its firm rejection of any action leading to a change of government by force, in violation of the cardinal principle of the African Union (AU) on this issue.",
		"Algeria calls on all the concerned actors to show a sense of responsibility and to give priority to dialogue in order to preserve the peaceful conduct of the transition and maintain peace and stability in the country.",
		"Algeria reaffirms its support for the Malian transitional authorities, under the leadership of the Head of State Bah N'Daw, to whom it has continued to provide multifaceted support in order to ensure return of constitutional order, based on the commitments made under the Transitional Charter adopted on 12 September 2020, and endorsed by the UN, AU and ECOWAS."
