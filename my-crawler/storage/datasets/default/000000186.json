		"Minister of Foreign Affairs and National Community Abroad, Ramtane Lamamra on Tuesday advocated a multidimensional approach to challenges arising from both the illicit financial and weapons into Africa.Speaking at the Ministerial session of the African Union Peace and Security Council (AUPSC) on “the interdependence between peace, security and development,” Lamamra drew the Council’s attention to the challenges arising from both the illicit financial flows out of Africa and the illicit weapons flows into Africa, which must be dealt with in a comprehensive manner.”“While redoubling our collective efforts to achieve the full potential of these critical instruments for continental integration and shared prosperity, we need also to continuously adapt our working methods to be able to address the underlying causes of conflicts through an integrated, inclusive, holistic and multidimensional approach,” stressed the FM.According to Lamamra, “the principle of African solutions to African problems shall continue to be pursued as a strategic objective that will steer our collective self-reliance while enabling balanced and responsible partnerships that respect Africa’s right to development and put an end to its long marginalization in all areas of international life.”"
