		"The Minister of Foreign Affairs and National Community Abroad, Mr. Ramtane Lamamra received, Tuesday in Algiers, the President of the Andean Parliament, Ms. Gloria Flores Schneider, who pays a visit to Algeria to participate, as a guest, in the 17th Conference of the Union of Parliaments of Member States of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.",
		"The meeting focused on the historical relations of solidarity and cooperation between Africa and Latin America and the promising prospects for their strengthening through the values uniting the countries and peoples of both regions, forged in their common struggles for emancipation from the colonial yoke and which are manifested today in their unconditional support for the just causes of the Palestinian and Sahrawi peoples, as well as in their shared desire to promote the principles of non-alignment for a peaceful and fair world."
