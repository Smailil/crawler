		"Algeria condemns, in the strongest terms, Israeli occupation forces' \"racist and extremist attacks\" against the Palestinians in occupied Al-Quds and depriving them from performing their religious rites in the Mosque of Al-Aqsa",
		"as well as the repeated attempts to legitimize the logic of dispossession of other peopleâ€™s lands by force and the imposition of sovereignty over the Holy City, in flagrant violation of the resolutions of international legitimacy.In the face of these serious violations that the Israeli occupation authorities are committing against the defenseless Palestinian people, Algeria calls on the international community, including the UN Security Council, to act urgently to ensure the necessary protection of the Palestinian people and its sacred places and to put an end to these criminal acts and to the Israeli occupation policy in the Palestinian territories.Algeria underlines its full solidarity and constant support to the Palestinian people in its heroic struggle against the Israeli occupation and reaffirms its strong support to the Palestinian cause until the recovery by the Palestinian people of its legitimate and inalienable rights, at the top of which the establishment of an independent State with El-Quds as its capital."
