		"In this regard, the Chinese ambassador welcomed the progress made by Algeria in terms of improving the business climate and investment in Algeria, expressing the major interest given by Chinese economic operators to the conclusion of partnerships with their Algerian counterparts especially in view of the promising opportunities offered by the new law on investment that ensures legislative stability and a better vision for foreign investors.",

		"Regarding the issue of Western Sahara, Mr. Amar Belani affirmed to the Chinese ambassador that the current stalemate in the negotiation process between the Moroccan Kingdom and the Polisario Front was due mainly to the procrastination of the Moroccan side that wants to impose its unrealistic and unworkable autonomy project in the territory of Western Sahara, in violation of all UN resolutions and calls of the UN Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy Staffan de Mistura, the need to resume negotiations between the two parties to the conflict in good faith and without preconditions.",
		"Mr. Belani warned against the irresponsible Moroccan position that relies on the status quo, with the complicity of well-known states and through the conclusion of doubtful and shameful deals, which represents a serious challenge to the stability and security of the region that Algeria intends to protect in all determination, responsibility and wisdom.",
