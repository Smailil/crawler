		"Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Sabri Boukadoum, will take part on Thursday in the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly scheduled to take place at UN headquarters in New York to discuss the latest developments in Palestine and crimes against the Palestinian people in the occupied territories, in particular in El-Quds and Ghaza.During the meeting, Mr oukadoum will deliver a speech on behalf of the Arab Group, chaired by Algeria during the month of May, and meet with senior UN officials, headed by its Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, and General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir, and many of his counterparts scheduled to attend the meeting.In the face of the Security Council's failure to take a clear stand on the Zionist aggression against the defenseless Palestinians, Algeria, on behalf of the Arab Group, and Niger, on behalf of the the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), called for a meeting of the General Assembly with a view to bringing the United Nations to assume its responsibility to put an end to the aggressions committed by the occupying forces against the Palestinians and use all available means to protect them and their holy places."
