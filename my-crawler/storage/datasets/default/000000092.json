		"The Minister of Foreign Affairs and National Community Abroad, Mr. Ramtane LAMAMRA, had a phone conversation today with his Finnish counterpart, Mr. Pekka HAAVISTO, at the initiative of the latter.  \n \nThe two Ministers were particularly pleased with the quality of historical relations between the two countries marked by friendship and solidarity and which celebrate in this month of January their 60th anniversary. They also took this opportunity to exchange views on a number of issues related to regional and international matters, as well as on upcoming multilateral events of common interest.   \n \nIn this regard, the heads of diplomacy of Algeria and Finland discussed the preparation of the 20th meeting of Foreign Ministers of African and Nordic countries, scheduled for this spring in Algiers. Minister LAMAMRA assured his interlocutor that by succeeding Finland at the head of this framework of Afro-Nordic consultation, Algeria will spare no effort to consolidate the rapprochement between these countries in the continuation of their traditional attachment to the aims and principles consecrated in the United Nations Charter.",
