		"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Community abroad commemorated this Sunday in Algiers, the National Day of the Shaheed, corresponding to February 18th of each year, under the supervision of the Secretary General, Mr. Amar Belani, affirming the unwavering commitment of Algeria to the Message of November, which remains the compass that guides the people and a rampart that immunizes its cohesion and preserves its sovereignty over the land of sacrifices.",
		"After the raising of the national emblem, Mr. Belani has proceeded to the laying of a wreath of flowers at the memorial stele erected in the esplanade of the Ministry in memory of the Shouhada. A speech was, then, pronounced by the General Secretary on the occasion of this commemoration."
